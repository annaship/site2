The Goddess and Mantle







	In the Campo Santa Margherita, on the wall of the Confraternity of the Leatherworkers, a frieze depicts the Virgin Mary enveloping dwarf-sized worshippers with a voluminous protective mantle.



	In the sixth century BC, a late Iron Age tribe called the Venetii worshipped a female deity called Reitia, the Goddess of all living things.   Hundreds of little bronze effigies of Reitia have been excavated at Este, near Padua.   Reitia always wears a mantle over her head.   Today, on a wall in the Campo San Lucca in Venice, a medieval, iconic Madonna peers out of her vulva-like headcovering in much the same way as does her ancestress Reitia.



	In ancient Greece, every year the priestesses of Athena wove an elaborate story cloth and sewed it into a robe called a peplos.   In a ceremony they presented the peplos to the goddess, draping it over her fifty-foot-high statue on the Acropolis.



	In medieval times Venetians painted and sculpted La Madonna della Misericordia, (Mary with the Enveloping Mantle), all over the inside and outside of churches and confraternities.   The Virgin's billowing cloak creates a dark, hollow space promising warmth and protection.   There is a strong link in Venetian art and culture between a woman's flowing robes and her suggested spiritual and psychological powers.   







The Dangling String







	On the campanile of the Catholic church, I Carmini, in Campo Santa Margherita, a statue of the Madonna standing on a crescent moon holds two strings attached to what appears to be a wet rag.   This represents the Scapular, a sacred cloth which Mary offers to the Carmelite faithful, who believe that it can protect them from the eternal fires of Purgatory.   How far back in Mediterranean cultural history can we trace a link between women and suspended, sacred cloth?



	Marija Gimbutas in her The Language of the Goddess documents the Bronze Age worship of a Snake Goddess, who often sports a snake-like girdle.   Elizabeth Wayland Barber in her Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years, uses linguistic reconstruction of a proto-Indo-European language and visual clues found in Paleolithic figurines to discover an ancient link between string girdles worn by women since the Gravettian culture of 20,000 BC and women's fertility, sexuality, and spiritual powers.   The word zoster, which means a sacred girdle, dates from 3,000 BC and is found today in Greece as zostra, a fringed red skirt used as a talisman for women in labor.   Barber believes that this girdle was the ancestress of the hundred-tasselled zone, Aphrodite's belt or girdle, which contained all of her amorous powers.



	Jungian analyst Ann Shearer in her book Athene: Image and Energy, describes an archaic 5,000 BC statue of Athene: on a pediment on the Acropolis the goddess holds out a cape fringed with writhing snakes, symbols of regeneration and eternal life.   On the island of Crete, mid-second-millennium Snake Goddesses wore snakes on their wrists and waists.   For ancient Egyptians the knot on the girdle of the goddess Isis was a symbol of the key of fertility and life.   A fresco in a family altar in a home in Pompeii visually connects the loop of a woman's shawl and the coils of a serpent.



	Marina Warner, in her Alone of All her Sex, the Myth and the Cult of the Virgin Mary, shows how the tradition of Aphrodite's girdle and the girdle of the Amazon Queen Hippolyta was transmuted into Mary's girdle or belt.   I suggest that the girdle which the Madonna gives to Doubting Thomas as she ascends heavenward in Venetian painter Palma il Vecchio's Assumption of the Virgin is a variation on the magic girdle theme and is thematically connected to the symbolic serpents of the Cretan Snake-Goddesses and to the chthonic Athene.   Titian's Madonna as she surges heavenward reenacts this iconographic tradition.







The Omega Shawl







	An ancient Greek and Roman dancing maenad, a frenzied follower of the wine god Dionysus, twirls a scarf shaped like the Greek letter omega behind her back.   Here is a dancer on the walls of the House of Mysteries in Pompeii.   All throughout subsequent Italian art, the omega shawl motif seems to symbolize that the bearer is in the throes of emotional passion.   Here the shape of Venus's scarf signals to Mantegna's audiences that the love goddess is ecstatic about her union with Mars.   Here the fullness of Europa's shawl tells us that she is not entirely unwilling to be abducted by the white bull.	



	In the eighteenth century Tiepolo painted elaborate clouds of swirling fabric around his women.   A close look at his Baroque ceiling frescoes reveals that the shapes of his draperies give information about the emotional state of his female subjects.   There is a complex language here waiting to be deciphered.
