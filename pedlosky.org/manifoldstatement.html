        Brown's best-selling thriller <i>The Da Vinci Code </i>opens in the Grand 
        Gallery of the Louvre in Paris with the discovery of a bizarre corpse: 
        before expiring, the murdered curator had drawn around his navel in blood 
        an ancient symbol connoting Venus. Tracking the killer, Harvard professor 
        of religious and mythic symbolism Robert Langdon and French cryptologist 
        Sophie Neveu follow labyrinthine paths leading to and through underground 
        bank vaults, subterranean crypts, dank medieval tombs, and dark, twisted 
        minds. They eventually unearth long-repressed archaic rituals of the worship 
        of female potency, which is encrypted in Mediterranean art and culture.</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="Headingmedium"><br>
        </span><span class="Headingbig">But 
        if, instead of Paris, the two sleuths had searched in Venice, Italy, they 
        would have found that these chthonic mysteries, which proclaim the sacral 
        power and fecundity of women, are out in the open, above ground, everywhere: 
        on altars, on walls, and in the air.<br>
        </span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="Headingbig"><br>
        Like the Da Vinci de-coders, I have been working on the unravelling of 
        a mystery: what are the layers of meaning encoded in laundry lines in 
        Venice, Italy? For many Venetian women, why is the act of hanging out 
        clothes to dry on a line such a vital ritual? And how to decipher the 
        code of symbols surrounding the use of draped and dangling cloth in Venetian 
        art?</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="Headingbig">On 
        one level my pictures here are just clothes hanging out to dry. But if 
        you are in Venice, Italy, you might notice that some Venetian<i> casalinghe</i> 
        (traditional Italian housewives) hang out their clothes (and often their 
        shoes, furs, rags, baby toys and carriages) with a certain individual 
        style. They can recognize each other's lines, for each cord is like a 
        bird's song which says &quot;This is me, this is my family, this is my 
        territory.&quot;</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="Headingbig">But 
        even more is going on. Spend some time in Venice, and you will see that 
        there is a language, with ancient roots, of draped and suspended fabric 
        in Venetian art and culture. From the knot of Inanna and Isis to what 
        I call the Omega shawl, cloth has its iconography in Mediterranean art 
        from 4,000 BC to the present. I do not claim that the Venetian <i>casalinga</i> 
        is conscious of the symbolism of suspended fabric in Venetian cultural 
        history, but she would feel that her act of putting clothes out to dry 
        on a high cord in public would have a visual resonance with her culture&#146;s 
        construction of the Good, the Beautiful, even the Sacred.</span></p>
