      <p><b><font size="4">Venetian Light 2001 offers you a different Venice than 
        you could find on your own or with any other group. You will discover 
        an ancient civilization which is very vibrant in the present, whose children 
        still speak the Venetian dialect, where 1,500 years of human stories speak 
        to you from every wall and campo. This most public of cities also has 
        its inner secrets, and with Holly Smith Pedlosky you will be able to enter 
        gardens, palaces, and homes closed to the ordinary tourist. </font></b>

        photographer in Venice you will feel, with Proust, that you have a new

          rhythm: the class will meet in the mornings and late afternoons for 
          technical sessions and for group critiques. Middays and evenings are 
          free for eating, sleeping, exploring Venice, perhaps going to a Vivaldi 
          concert in Vivaldi's church, and making new friends and new pictures. 
          In addition, there will be ample free time to shoot and to have individual 
          work review sessions with the instructors. </font></font></b></p>

        <p>This is a workshop for all levels of photographers, beginner through 
          advanced. Participants will be divided into two groups, depending on 
          your skill level and what you want to learn. </p>
        <p>Technical problems concerning basic camera skills (cameras, tripods, 
          films, filters, depth of field, motion, macro photography, and the aperture-shutter 
          speed trade-off) will be solved in slide talks and optional sessions.
