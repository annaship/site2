      <p><strong>taught by Holly Smith Pedlosky </strong></p>
      <p><strong>one day, &nbsp;</strong>Monday 1/28/08, 10am-4:00pm.</p>
      <p>From Leonardo to present-day computer cameras, a camera is basically just a box with a hole in it, and most of the controls and the choices you have simply tell it how much light to let through that hole. </p>
      <p>Whether you shoot with film or digital sensors, the key to getting what you want is to understand how your camera exposes an image. This one-day workshop will teach you the basics of shooting photographs: proper exposure, manual vs. automatic camera operation, exposure compensation (EV), shutter speeds and capturing motion, apertures and depth of field, ISO and light sensitivity, white balance, resolution, and focusing choices.</p>
      <p>This workshop will teach you how to talk to your camera so it will listen to you and how to listen so it can talk to you.</p>
    <p>For beginners-intermediates, analog and/or digital photographers; one day, Monday 1/28/08, 10am-4:00pm. </p>
    <p>Cost: $100 </p>
    <p>Room: Wolf 201</p>
