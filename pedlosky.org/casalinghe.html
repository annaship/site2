        have come to know many <i><b>Venetian casalinghe</b></i>, traditional 
        Italian housewives. I explain to them that I am researching their artful 
        way of hanging clothes. Then each tells me about her mother's way, and 
        her own, of hanging up clothes to dry: in the sun, in the shade, under 
        moonlight, on the grass, in the morning, after lunch. Some will hang clothing 
        in order of size, (little socks, then larger socks), and some will hang 
        by color, or by type of clothing. Poorer women in small apartments without 
        an outside line will hang shirts and towels suspended from each other 
        from one window, so that the whole looks like the sails on a clipper ship. 
        Each woman has her own style, and her line is her signature, her own music 
        which, like a birdsong, says to the outside world &quot;This is me; this 
        is my territory; this is my family.&quot;</font></font>

          <font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The <i><b>casalinghe</b></i> 
          consider hanging laundry to be an ancient and important ritual. Clothes 
          dryers are almost nonexistent in Venice; everyone uses clothelines, 
          but older Venetian <i><b>casalinghe</b></i> are all sad that their daughters 
          and grandaughters have no time for doing it with style. <br>
          Now I began to read laundry lines as if they were lines of a diary written 
          by a woman in her home. An Italian woman expresses herself in the air. 
          She hangs out her furs, her lingerie, her husband's hats and rowing 
          club shirts, and her children's soccer uniforms and team pennants. Watching, 
          you can learn about their ages, their politics, their sizes. A <i><b>casalinga</b></i> 
          shows you who she is and who she wants to be.</font>

          <div align="center">This is my good friend Margherita Citon, Venice's 
            first woman to win the Regata Storica rowing race. She turned fifty 
            years old the next year, and the regatta committee told her she was 
            too old to enter the race. She sued and won the suit and the next 
            Regata Storica. Margherita is a farmer on the Island of San Erasmo. 
            She shows me her figs. </div>

            This is how I met Antonia. She told me that the secret of life was 
            a real <i><b>mamma casalinga</b></i>. Without loving homes and good 
            food, children don't grow up right; the center doesn't hold, and the 
            world will fall apart, says Antonia.</font>

            Here is Amelia, asking me why I am taking her picture and where I 
            am going to send her, where I am going to show the picture. She refused 
            to send her wedding ring to Mussolini when he ordered Italian housewives 
            to give him their gold for Fascist the war effort; instead she sold 
            it for food for her children, who were much more important than Il 
            Duce, she says. She is 88 years old: &quot;This new world is not my 
            world,&quot; says Amelia.</font>

          <font size="+1">The Giudecca is a world all of its own. Traditionally 
          it has been an island of fishermen and workers in the ship construction 
          business, whose politics tends towards a Che Guevara-inspired romantic 
          communism. Tourism has made some inroads, but back behind the <i><b>Fondamenta</b></i> 
          along the Giudecca Canal live real Venetians. 
          <p> This is Rina who has raised eight kids with her fisherman husband, 
            all of whom turned out well, she says emphatically. Rina would call 
            me up in the morning and say &quot;Olli! I've just hung up my best 
            sheets. Come right over and photograph them.&quot; This is Renata, 
            and this is Renata's handiwork; the backdrop is the Women's Prison.
