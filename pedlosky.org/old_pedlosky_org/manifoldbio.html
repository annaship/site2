      <p class="textblack"> <span class="text">Holly Smith Pedlosky is an artist-photographer 
        who teaches photography, the history of photography, and digital imaging 
        at the Lesley Seminars at Lesley University, (formerly Radcliffe Seminars 
        at Harvard University). At Radcliffe in 1997 she founded Photography Atelier, 
        a workshop for emerging photographic artists. Holly and Karen Davis together 
        reinvented Photography Atelier in 2001, and they now co-teach it at Lesley 
        Seminars in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Photography Atelier is a unique 
        course, combining workshops and critiques with looks at significant past 
        and contemporary photography.</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="text"><br>
        Holly has been teaching intensive photo workshops in Italy (in Venice, 
        and on Lake Como) since 1985, and since 1993 she has been offering intensive 
        summer photography courses in Italy for the International Center of Photography, 
        which is based in New York City.</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="text"><br>
        Holly graduated with a BA from Radcliffe College at Harvard University 
        where she studied art history. She got an MA in urban planning from the 
        University of Colorado. Moving to Chicago, she then changed fields and 
        devoted her professional energies to photography. She completed an MFA 
        from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she studied with 
        Generative Systems founder and artist, <a href="http://www.sonart.org">Sonia 
        Landy Sheridan</a>.</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="text"><br>
        Holly has lived for two years and many summers in Venice Italy. In 1994-95 
        she won a Gladys Kriebel Delmas Foundation Fellowship to photograph laundry 
        on islands in the Venetian Lagoon and the <i>casalinghe</i>, (traditional 
        Italian housewives), who hang it. She photographs these Sibylline older 
        Venetian women, their art of hanging laundry, and the language of suspended 
        cloth in Venetian life and art. She is also researching the themes of 
        eros and generativity in the work of the 19th century pioneer photographer 
        Julia Margaret Cameron.</span></p>
      <p class="textblack"><span class="text"><br>
        Holly shoots traditional color slides, and she prints her work digitally; 
        she has an international exhibition record. She has exhibited her work 
        at galleries and museums in Boston, Chicago, Venice, Italy, and on Cape 
        Cod, Massachusetts where she lives. </span></p>
