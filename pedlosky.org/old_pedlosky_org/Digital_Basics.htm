      <p><strong>taught by Holly Smith Pedlosky </strong></p>
      <p>For digital beginners-intermediates</p>
      <p>one day, Monday 2/4/08, 10am-4:00pm.</p>
      <p>Have you so far resisted the lures of Digital Photography but now kind-of wish you knew more about it? Have you shot a whole lot of digital images but don&rsquo;t know how to find them again? Or what to do with them if you find them? </p>
      <p>This workshop will use Adobe Photoshop CS3 to give you the tools to understand your camera and to make digital photography your friend. You will learn how to shoot with an automatic setting but always have full manual control using overrides. You will learn how to use Adobe Bridge to organize and archive your photographs. You will learn about formatting photographs to send as e-mails and how to design photographic books of your images and publish them on-line.</p>
      <p>For digital beginners-intermediates; one day, Monday 2/4/08, 10am-4:00pm. Room: Wolf 201</p>
      <p>Cost: $100 </p>
