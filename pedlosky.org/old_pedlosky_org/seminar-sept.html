<b>In this seminar, students will make, look at, think and talk about photographs which expand our cultural sense of the female self.›› 

<p>

The advent of photography in 1839 cut through old dichotomies which had polarized Western culture for centuries: Art vrs. Science, Ideal vrs. Real, Body vrs. Mind, Female vrs. Male, Pagan vrs. Christian, Lower Class vrs. Upper Class.››› Photography created a new space within which women, as subjects, constructors of family albums, and photographers,

were free to reinvent themselves and to interact with their enveloping cultures to negotiate new identities.

<p>

For this workshop each student, with the help of the instructor and supportive group critiques, will work on a personal portfolio in any photographic medium, (slides or prints, color or black and white, still or video).›› At the end of the course, each student will make a presention of original work which relates to the central theme of this

course: the investigation of the experience of being a woman.

<p>

Simultaneously, this class will examine the work and the life histories of some of the men and women, subjects as well as photographers, (in particular Georgia OÌKeeffe, Stieglitz, Annie Brigman, Tina Modotti, Imogene Cunningham, Lee Miller, Dorothea Lange, Margaret Bourke-White, Cindy Sherman, Sally Mann, Flor Garduno, Carrie Mae Weems, & Sonia Landy Sheridan), who changed the terms of the discourse about gender and about the role of art in 20th century culture.››› The seminar will look at how women and girls are depicted in recent fine arts photography and advertising, and students will confront some of the ethical issues raised by photographs of nude women and girls by such photographers as

Robert Mapplethorpe, Jock Sturges, and Sally Mann.›› We will ask how Erik Erikson's theories about identity formation illuminate the history of photography.

<p>

This Seminar is a combination of three elements:› First, we will look at the work and life histories of significant photographers.›› Second, students will bring their own work in any photographic medium, (slides or› prints, color or black and white, straight or electronic imaging).›Third, the instructor will offer advice, information, and assignments,

appropriate to the needs of each student, about the fundamental techniques of camera work: films, filters, light, exposure, and composition.›› Each student will complete a final photographic project. Participants need to have a camera of any format, in excellent working condition.
