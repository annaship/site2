        <p class="cit_body">...to go to Italy... is like a most fascinating act of
              self-discovery&nbsp;&#8212; back, back down the old ways of time.
              Strange and wonderful chords awaken in us and vibrate again after
              many hundreds of years of forgetfulness.</p>

    <p>Venetian Spaces are not like any other spaces. Until you go there, it is 
      impossible to know how the absence of cars, motorcycles, trucks,
      highways,&nbsp;&amp; parking lots affects the way spaces open up to accept a person on foot.</p>
    <p>Because Venetian spaces are quiet, and because there are no get-away 
      vehicles for crime perpetrators, these openings envelope those who wander
      into them with a sense of being safe, of being at peace, of being well&nbsp;&#8212; of well-being.</p>
    <p>These images convey a sense of what it feels like to be in Venice,
      enveloped by the past, the present, the beauty, the decay, the warmth,
      the vistas, the delight, the light, the darkness&nbsp;&#8212; the physical
      and emotional <span class="italic_em">chiaroscuro</span> of Italian spaces.</p>
    <p>I integrate between 3&nbsp;&amp; 23 individual photographic shots to make my panoramas.</p>
