    <p>I am an artist, photographer,&nbsp;&amp; teacher. I spend part of each year in Venice, Italy.</p>
    <p>A black&nbsp;&amp; white darkroom photographer for 25 years, 
      I began to shoot color slides during the first year I spent in Venice.
      Frustrated by the problem of making accurate photographic prints from transparencies,
      I embraced digital printing early on. Now that digital cameras have surpassed their 35mm equivalents,
      I shoot digitally. I don&#39;t look back.</p>
    <p>I founded Photography Atelier at the Radcliffe Seminars in 1997,
      bringing the program to Lesley University in 2002. In 1985 I taught experimental photography in Venice,
      Italy for the Centro Fotografia. In 2005 I co-founded a summer photography program for
      Northeastern University in Venice, and I taught in it through 2009. </p>
    <p>I continue to teach intensive digital photo workshops in Venice&nbsp;&amp; on Lake Como,
      Italy for the International Center of Photography, based in New York City.
      My next Venice workshop for ICP, Venetian Light&nbsp;&amp; Life: from Within, will be September 17&ndash;28, 2011.

    <p>I have a BA in Fine Arts from Harvard University, an MA from the University of Colorado in urban 
      planning,&nbsp;&amp; an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where I studied with
      Sonia Landy Sheridan, artist&nbsp;&amp; founder of the Generative Systems program.</p>
