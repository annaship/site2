      Venice&nbsp;&amp; the Secrets of Women:<br/>
      <span class="italic_em">Casalinghe</span>&nbsp;&amp; Sibyls
    </div>
      <p>In the middle of my life I found myself, quite unlike Dante, in the middle of a vast and luminous lagoon dotted with floating little islands, each covered with airborne displays of women&#39;s work. The first thing a New England woman with a Puritan heritage coming to Italy is aware of is that she is in a culture where women are venerated. </p>
      <p>With a year in Venice in front of me, I felt like Belle in Jean Cocteau&#39;s <span class="italic_em">La Belle et la B&ecirc;te</span>: doors kept springing open in front of me, inviting me to experience I knew not what. </p>
      <p>That year and during many subsequent sojourns in Venice, a desire grew in me to understand why older Italian women, (they were the repressed objects of the Male Gaze, house-arrested victims of the Patriarchy, were they not?), exulted in their own identities.</p>
      <p>I got a Gladys Klebel Delmas Foundation grant to interview and videotape Venetian <span class="italic_em">casalinghe</span>, traditional Italian housewives,&nbsp;&amp; I return to Venice each year and photograph them&nbsp;&amp; their art of hanging laundry.</p>
      <p>A <span class="italic_em">casalinga</span> is a woman who finds pleasure, meaning,&nbsp;&amp; purpose in creating a home that nourishes those whom she loves. She can also be a sibyl.</p>
      <p>Sibyls were ancient Greek prophetesses who understood how the world works. Far from being evangelists, they kept their knowledge of the past, present,&nbsp;&amp; future in secret books, and they would impart their wisdom only to those who journeyed to seek it.  </p>
      <p>From the Middle Ages on in Italy, the mythology of the Sibyl ripened&nbsp;&amp; deepened. She could be a mysterious sage like the Queen of Sheba, a seductive witch like Circe, a loving mother like Saint Anne, a wrinkled&nbsp;&amp; muscular virago like Michelangelo&#39;s Cumaean Sibyl on the Sistine ceiling. </p>
      <p>Sibyls always had a story to tell, whether or not anyone was listening. In the realm of the psyche, their power was immense. In the public sphere they were often invisible.</p>
      <p>This portfolio is about some Venetian Sibyls.</p>
