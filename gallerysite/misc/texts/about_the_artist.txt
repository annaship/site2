Holly Smith Pedlosky
I am an artist, photographer, & teacher. I spend part of each year in Venice, Italy.
A black & white darkroom photographer for 25 years, I began to shoot color slides during the first year I spent in Venice. Frustrated by the problem of making accurate photographic prints from transparencies, I embraced digital printing early on. Now that digital cameras have surpassed their 35mm equivalents, I shoot digitally. I don’t look back.
I founded Photography Atelier at the Radcliffe Seminars in 1997, bringing the program to Lesley University in 2002. In 1985 I taught experimental photography in Venice, Italy for the Centro Fotografia. In 2005 I co-founded a summer photography program for Northeastern University in Venice, and I taught in it through 2009. 
I continue to teach intensive digital photo workshops in Venice & on Lake Como, Italy for the International Center of Photography, based in New York City. My next Venice workshop for ICP, Venetian Light & Life: from Within, will be September 17-28, 2011. For more information, please visit: http://www.italyphotoworkshops.org.
I have a BA in Fine Arts from Harvard University, an MA from the University of Colorado in urban planning, & an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where I studied with Sonia Landy Sheridan, artist & founder of the Generative Systems program.
