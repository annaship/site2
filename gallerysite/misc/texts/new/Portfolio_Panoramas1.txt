<p>Venice is sinking; Venice is decaying; Venice is dying. This is nothing new. Venice has been doing this for 1,500 years.</p>
<p>But there is vitality in this corrosion, life in this rot. </p>
<p>Venice, like her opera house La Fenice (The Phoenix)&#8212;three times destroyed by fire&nbsp;&amp; rebuilt&#8212;continually gives birth to herself, is reborn.</p>
<p>In Venetian ruins, in modern sculptures found in ancient buildings, I find new life.</p>
<p>I create these panoramas using between 3&nbsp;&amp; 24 separate digital camera shots that I integrate using Adobe Photoshop.</p>
