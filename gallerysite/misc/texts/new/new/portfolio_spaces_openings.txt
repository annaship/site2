<p>Venetian Spaces: Openings</p>

<p><span class="italic_em">...to go to Italy... is like a most fascinating act of self-discovery&nbsp;&#8212; back, back down the old ways of time. Strange and wonderful chords awaken in us and vibrate again after many hundreds of years of forgetfulness.</span></p>

<p>Venetian Spaces are not like any other spaces. Until you go there, it is impossible to know how the absence of cars, motorcycles, trucks, highways,&nbsp;&amp; parking lots affects the way spaces open up to accept a person on foot.</p>
<p>Because Venetian spaces are quiet, and because there are no get-away vehicles for crime perpetrators, these openings envelope those who wander into them with a sense of being safe, of being at peace, of being well&nbsp;&#8212; of well-being.</p>
<p>These images convey a sense of what it feels like to be in Venice, enveloped by the past, the present, the beauty, the decay, the warmth, the vistas, the delight, the light, the darkness&nbsp;&#8212; the physical and emotional chiaroscuro of Italian spaces.</p>
