The Life in Death in Venice
 
Venice is sinking; Venice is decaying; Venice is dying. This is nothing new. Venice has been doing this for 1,500 years.
But there is vitality in this corrosion, life in this rot. 
Venice, like her opera house La Fenice (The Phoenix)—three times destroyed by fire & rebuilt--continually gives birth to herself, is reborn.
In Venetian ruins, in modern sculptures found in ancient buildings, I find new life.
I create these panoramas using between 3 & 24 separate digital camera shots that I integrate using Adobe Photoshop.
